# FriendFinder

An app that uses html, css, and Bootstrap for the client side and Javascript and Express for the back end. Deployed on Heroku here: https://thawing-plains-53275.herokuapp.com/

### Dependencies
You will need to install the Express and Path dependencies
```
npm i express path
```

## The Concept
A survey you can take that will get your input about pizza toppings and search the database of other users and find the closest match.
